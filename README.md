# SteemPoll — Application on top of Steem

Autonomous and decentralized voting application utilizing Steem blockchain!


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `steempoll` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `steempoll` repository.

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `steempoll`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed.

### Clone `steempoll`

Clone the `steempoll` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/feruzm/steempoll.git
cd steempoll
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].
* In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have the
  [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] installed on your machine. Check out the section on
  [end-to-end testing](#e2e-testing) for more info.

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `docs/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`steempoll` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `docs` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].


## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the `steempoll` application: Unit tests and end-to-end tests.

### Running Unit Tests

The `steempoll` app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in [Jasmine][jasmine],
which we run with the [Karma][karma] test runner. We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* The configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`.
* The unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and have an `_test.js` suffix (e.g.
  `polls_test.js`).

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will start
watching the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them
changes.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit. This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected. The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
npm run test-single-run
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

The `steempoll` app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests
are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner. It uses native events and has
special features for Angular applications.

* The configuration is found at `e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js`.
* The end-to-end tests are found in `e2e-tests/scenarios.js`.

Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds
correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor can
interact with it.

**Before starting Protractor, open a separate terminal window and run:**

```
npm start
```

In addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver, we need to ensure that it is installed and
up-to-date. The `steempoll` project is configured to do this automatically before running the
end-to-end tests, so you don't need to worry about it. If you want to manually update the WebDriver,
you can run:

```
npm run update-webdriver
```

Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running, you
can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:

```
npm run protractor
```

This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the
development server.

## Updating Angular

Since the Angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (npm and
bower) you can use these tools to easily update the dependencies. Simply run the preconfigured
script:

```
npm run update-deps
```

This will call `npm update` and `bower update`, which in turn will find and install the latest
versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` and `bower.json` files
respectively.


## Serving the Application Files

While Angular is client-side-only technology and it is possible to create Angular web apps that
do not require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local
web server during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, XHR,
etc to function properly when an HTML page is opened via the `file://` scheme instead of `http://`.

### Running the App during Development

The `steempoll` project comes preconfigured with a local development web server. It is a Node.js
tool called [http-server][http-server]. You can start this web server with `npm start`, but you may
choose to install the tool globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

```
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own web server, such as Apache or Nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `docs/` directory.

### Running the App in Production

All you need in production are the files under the `docs/` directory.
Everything else should be omitted.


## Continuous Integration

### Travis CI

[Travis CI][travis] is a continuous integration service, which can monitor GitHub for new commits to
your repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests. The `steempoll`
project contains a Travis configuration file, `.travis.yml`, which will cause Travis to run your
tests when you push to GitHub.

You will need to enable the integration between Travis and GitHub. See the
[Travis website][travis-docs] for instructions on how to do this.
